##man pages

Man pages are great.

Man pages for functions you need to call are really great.

Man pages for functions you need to call are especially great when they tell
you how to call them in a consistent way.

That's where h comes in.

##h

Instead of switching out of your editor, looking at the man page, committing
the function prototype to short term memory, switching back to your editor,
and then trying not to forget it while you remember what arguments you wanted
to pass, why not just have the prototype show up right there?

##awk

So, since I didn't need the whole man page, I wrote an awk script to pull out
just the protoype. Then I wrote a shell script so I could just pass the
function name and get the prototype I wanted.

##vim

And then I switched from ed to vim.

So now, instead of ! commands showing on the same screen, I get temporarily
dropped out of curses mode... Square one.

So I wrote a little .vimrc snippet to make it show in the status region and
mapped it to a double press of the default man page mapping.

You're welcome.
